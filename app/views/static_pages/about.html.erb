  <p style="clear: both;">Ingrid is an artist-run project space in a domestic setting.
  </br>
  More intimate than a public or commercial gallery, it is interested in doing less and spending more time with what it does.
  </br>
  Through hosting small-scale events and exhibitions it aims to generate informal and concentrated situations of exchange and new friendships.</p>
